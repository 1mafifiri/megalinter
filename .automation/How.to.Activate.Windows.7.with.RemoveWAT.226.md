## What is RemoveWAT 2.2.6?
 
RemoveWAT 2.2.6 is a software that can disable the WAT from your Windows 7 system, making it appear as if it was activated with a valid license key. WAT is a technology that Microsoft introduced in Windows 7 to prevent piracy and enforce activation. WAT checks your system periodically to verify that your copy of Windows is genuine and not tampered with. If WAT detects any signs of piracy, such as using a cracked or invalid key, it will display a message on your desktop saying that your Windows is not genuine and restrict some features and updates.
 
RemoveWAT 2.2.6 can bypass this check by deleting the WAT files from your system and modifying some registry entries. This way, your Windows will not be able to detect any activation issues and will function normally as if it was activated with a genuine key.
  
## Is RemoveWAT 2.2.6 Safe and Effective?
 
RemoveWAT 2.2.6 is one of the most popular tools for activating Windows 7 among users who do not want to pay for a license key. However, using this tool comes with some risks and drawbacks that you should be aware of before downloading and installing it.

This is considered as software piracy and can result in legal consequences such as fines or lawsuits from Microsoft or other parties who own the rights to Windows 7.
- **Risk of system instability:** RemoveWAT 2.2.6 is a tool that modifies some critical files and registry entries in your system that are related to the activation process of Windows 7.
